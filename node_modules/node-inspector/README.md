## Overview

Node Inspector is a debugger interface for Node.js applications that uses the
Blink Developer Tools (formerly WebKit Web Inspector).

The project maintenance and support is sponsored by
[StrongLoop](http://strongloop.com).

## Quick Start

#### Install

```sh
$ npm install -g node-inspector
```

#### Start

```sh
$ node-debug app.js
```

where ```app.js``` is the name of your main Node application JavaScript file.

#### Debug

The `node-debug` command will load Node Inspector in your default browser.

> **NOTE:** Node Inspector works in Chrome and Opera only. You have to re-open
the inspector page in one of those browsers if another browser
is your default web browser (e.g. Safari or Internet Explorer).

Node Inspector works almost exactly as the Chrome Developer Tools. Read the
excellent
[DevTools overview](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/index)
to get started.

## Features

The Blink DevTools debugger is a powerful JavaScript debugger interface.
Node Inspector supports almost all of the debugging features of DevTools, including:

* Navigate in your source files
* Set breakpoints (and specify trigger conditions)
* Step over, step in, step out, resume (continue)
* Inspect scopes, variables, object properties
* Hover your mouse over an expression in your source to display its value in
  a tooltip
* Edit variables and object properties
* Continue to location
* Break on exceptions
* Disable/enable all breakpoints

### Cool stuff
* Node Inspector uses WebSockets, so no polling for breaks.
* Remote debugging
* [Live edit of running code](http://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/wiki/LiveEdit),
  optionally persisting changes back to the file-system.
* Set breakpoints in files that are not loaded into V8 yet - useful for
  debugging module loading/initialization.
* Javascript from top to bottom :)
* Embeddable in other applications - see [Embedding HOWTO](docs/embedding.md)
  for more details.

## Known Issues

* Automatic preloading of js files to set breakpoints will not work in
  symlinked directories. This is because the [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) module doesn't explore
  symlinked directories, and it doesn't return "real" paths ([issue](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/142).)
  The workaround is to allow the debugger to load those modules at runtime and then set the breakpoints.
  Not following symlinks does avoid long startup delays when there are symlink cycles.
* Be careful about viewing the contents of Buffer objects,
  each byte is displayed as an individual array element;
  for most Buffers this will take too long to render.
* While not stopped at a breakpoint the console doesn't always
  behave as you might expect. See the
  [issue #146](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/146).
* Profiler is not implemented yet. Have a look at
  [node-webkit-agent](https://github.com/c4milo/node-webkit-agent)
  in the meantime.
* Break on uncaught exceptions does not work in all Node versions,
  you need at least v0.11.3 (see
  [node#5713](https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/5713)).
* Debugging multiple processes (e.g. cluster) is cumbersome.

## Troubleshooting

#### My script runs too fast to attach the debugger.

The debugged process must be started with `--debug-brk`, this way the script is paused on the first line.

Note: `node-debug` adds this option for you by default.

#### I got the UI in a weird state.

When in doubt, refresh the page in browser

#### Can I debug remotely?

Yes. Node Inspector must be running on the same machine, but your browser can be anywhere.
Just make sure port 8080 is accessible.

#### How do I specify files to hide?

Create a JSON-encoded array.  You must escape quote characters when using a command-line option.

```sh
$ node-inspector --hidden='["node_modules/framework"]'
```

Note that the array items are interpreted as regular expressions.

#### UI doesn't load or doesn't work and refresh didn't help

Make sure that you have adblock disabled as well as any other content blocking scripts and plugins.

#### How can I (selectively) delete debug session metadata?

You may want to delete debug session metadata if for example Node Inspector gets in a bad state with some
watch variables that were function calls (possibly into some special c-bindings).  In such cases, even restarting
the application/debug session may not fix the problem.

Node Inspector stores debug session metadata in the HTML5 local storage.
You can inspect the contents of local storage and remove any items as
needed. In Google Chrome, you can execute any of the following in the JavaScript console:

```js
// Remove all
window.localStorage.clear()
// Or, to list keys so you can selectively remove them with removeItem()
window.localStorage
// Remove all the watch expressions
window.localStorage.removeItem('watchExpressions')
// Remove all the breakpoints
window.localStorage.removeItem('breakpoints')
```

When you are done cleaning up, hit refresh in the browser.

#### Node Inspector takes a long time to start up.

Try setting --no-preload to true. This option disables searching disk for *.js at startup.
Code will still be loaded into Node Inspector at runtime, as modules are required.

#### How do I debug Mocha unit-tests?

You have to start `_mocha` as the debugged process and make sure
the execution pauses on the first line. This way you have enough
time to set your breakpoints before the tests are run.

```sh
$ node-debug _mocha
```

#### How do I debug Gulp tasks?

If you are running on a Unix system you can simply run the following command.
The `$(which ..)` statement gets replaced with the full path to the gulp-cli.

```sh
$ node-debug $(which gulp) task
```

If you are running on Windows, you have to get the full path of `gulp.js`
to make an equivalent command:

```sh
> node-debug %appdata%\npm\node_modules\gulp\bin\gulp.js task
```
*You can omit the `task` part to run the `default` task.*

## Advanced Use

While running `node-debug` is a convenient way to start your debugging
session, there may come time when you need to tweak the default setup.

There are three steps needed to get you up and debugging:

#### 1. Start the Node Inspector server

```sh
$ node-inspector
```

You can leave the server running in background, it's possible to debug
multiple processes using the same server instance.

#### 2. Enable debug mode in your Node process

You can either start Node with a debug flag like:

```sh
$ node --debug your/node/program.js
```

or, to pause your script on the first line:

```sh
$ node --debug-brk your/short/node/script.js
```

Or you can enable debugging on a node that is already running by sending
it a signal:

1. Get the PID of the node process using your favorite method.
`pgrep` or `ps -ef` are good

    ```sh
    $ pgrep -l node
    2345 node your/node/server.js
    ```

2. Send it the USR1 signal

    ```sh
    $ kill -s USR1 2345
    ```

##### Windows

Windows does not support UNIX signals. To enable debugging, you can use
an undocumented API function `process._debugProcess(pid)`:

1. Get the PID of the node process using your favorite method, e.g.

    ```sh
    > tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq node.exe"

    Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage
    ========================= ======== ================ =========== ============
    node.exe                      3084 Console                    1     11,964 K
    ```

2. Call the API:

    ```sh
    > node -e "process._debugProcess(3084)"
    ```

#### 3. Load the debugger UI

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug?port=5858 in the Chrome browser.

## Configuration

Both `node-inspector` and `node-debug` use [rc](https://npmjs.org/package/rc) module 
to manage configuration options.

Places for configuration:
* command line arguments (parsed by [yargs](https://github.com/chevex/yargs))
* environment variables prefixed with ```node-inspector_```
* if you passed an option ```--config file``` then from that file
* a local ```.node-inspectorrc``` or the first found looking in ```./ ../ ../../
 ../../../``` etc.
* ```$HOME/.node-inspectorrc```
* ```$HOME/.node-inspector/config```
* ```$HOME/.config/node-inspector```
* ```$HOME/.config/node-inspector/config```
* ```/etc/node-inspectorrc```
* ```/etc/node-inspector/config```

All configuration sources that where found will be flattened into one object,
so that sources earlier in this list override later ones.
