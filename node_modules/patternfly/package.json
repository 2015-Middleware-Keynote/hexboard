  "readme": "# [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org) reference implementation\n\nThis reference implementation of PatternFly is based on [Bootstrap v3](http://getbootstrap.com/).  Think of PatternFly as a \"skinned\" version of Bootstrap with additional components and customizations.\n\n## Install with Bower\n\nPatternFly can be installed and managed through [Bower](http://bower.io/). To do so, either add `patternfly` as a dependency in your `bower.json` or run the following:\n\n```\nbower install patternfly\n```\n\n## RPM\n\nPatternFly is also available as an RPM.  See https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/patternfly/patternfly1/.\n\n## AngularJS\n\nA set of [common AngularJS directives](https://github.com/patternfly/angular-patternfly) for use with PatternFly is available.\n\n## Sass and/or Rails\n\nA [Sass port of PatternFly](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-sass) is available, as is a [Sass-based Rails Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/patternfly-sass).\n\n## Dependencies\n\nPatternFly incorporates other libraries and components; therefore, in addition to the contents of `dist`, the contents of `components` are also required for a complete installation of PatternFly.\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment setup requires nodejs and Ruby. If you do not already have nodejs, npm, and Ruby installed on your system, see https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager and https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads.\n\n### Install Bower\n\nAfter ensuring nodejs and npm are available, install [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally:\n\n    npm install -g bower\n\nBower is used to install and update PatternFly's dependencies.\n\n### Install Development Dependencies\n\nThe development includes the use of a number of helpful tasks. In order to setup your development environment to allow running of these tasks, you need to install the local nodejs packages declared in `package.json`. To do this run:\n\n    npm install\n\nThis will install all necessary development packages into `node_modules/`. At this point, the gruntjs tasks are available for use such as starting a local development server or building the master CSS file.\n\nAdditionally you may need to install the grunt command line utility.  To do this run:\n\n    npm install -g grunt-cli\n\nTest pages are generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  After ensuring Ruby is installed and available, run:\n\n    gem install jekyll\n\n### Live Reload Server\n\nA local development server can be quickly fired up by using the Gruntjs server task:\n\n    grunt server\n\nThis local static asset server (i.e., [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)) has the advantage of having livereload integration. Thus, if you start the Gruntjs server, any changes you make to `.html` or `.less` files will be automatically reloaded into your browser and the changes reflected almost immediately. This has the obvious benefit of not having to refresh your browser and still be able to see the changes as you add or remove them from your development files.  Additionally, any changes made to Jekyll source files (`tests-src/`) will trigger a Jekyll build.\n\n### Coding Style\n\n* Indentation\n    * Use spaces (not tabs)\n    * Indentation size is 2 spaces\n* Filenames\n    * All filenames will use a lowercase-hyphenated naming convention (e.g., single-select-dropdown.less)\n* LESSCSS\n    * CSS class names use lowercase-hyphenated naming convention (e.g., .navbar-nav)\n    * Alphabetize rules by selector\n    * Alphabetize properties by declaration\n    * Define or override variables centrally in less/variables.less\n    * Define or override mixins centrally in less/mixins.less\n\n## Build\n\n### CSS\n\nIn development, styling is written and managed through multiple lesscss files. In order to generate a CSS file of all styling, run the build Gruntjs task:\n\n    grunt build\n\nThis task will compile and minify the lesscss files into a single CSS file located at `dist/css/patternfly.min.css`.\n\n### PatternFlyIcons Font\n\nPatternFlyIcons font is generated using [IcoMoon](http://icomoon.io/app).  [Load](http://icomoon.io/#docs/save-load) `PatternFlyIcons-webfont.json` as a new project in IcoMoon and update as necessary.  Please commit the updated `PatternFlyIcons-webfont.json` file in addition to the updated font files and supporting LESS/CSS changes.\n\n## Tests\n\nThe `tests/` directory contains HTML pages with component and pattern examples in order to facilitate development.  Please consult the official documentation (see below) for full details on how to use PatternFly.\n\nThe HTML pages in `tests/` are generated using Jekyll.  Do *not* edit these files directly.  See `tests-src/` to change these files.\n\n## Release\n\nPatternFly is released through the Bower package manager and RPM. \n\n### Bower\n\nThe Bower package manager determines available versions and installs based upon git tags. To release a new version version of PatternFly, edit `bower.json`, `package.json`, and `MAKEFILE` accordingly.\n\nUpdate the version listed in `bower.json` by editing the file and changing the line:\n\n```\n\"version\": \"<new_version>\"\n```\n\nUpdate the version listed in `package.json` by editing the file and changing the line:\n\n```\n\"version\": \"<new_version>\"\n```\n\nUpdate the `MAKEFILE` by editing the file and changing the following lines:\n\n```\nVERSION=<new_version>\nMILESTONE=\n# PACKAGE_RPM_RELEASE=0.0.$(MILESTONE)\nPACKAGE_RPM_RELEASE=1\n```\n\nCommit the version bump:\n\n```\ngit commit -a -m \"Version bump to <new_version>\"\n```\n\nTag and push upstream (assuming you have commit access):\n\n```\ngit tag <new_version>\ngit push && git push --tags\n```\n\nThe new version will now be automatically available via Bower.\n\n### RPM\n\nRPMs of PatternFly Bower releases are built using Fedora or RHEL and rpm-build.\n\nVerify `MAKEFILE` is properly configured.\n\nMake the dist:\n\n```\nmake dist\n```\n\nCopy the resulting tarball from the previous step to your rpmbuild/SOURCES directory.\n\ne.g., `cp patternfly-1.1.1.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES`\n\nBuild the RPM:\n\n```\nrpmbuild -ba patternfly.spec\n```\n\nUpload the source RPM [1] to a public web server.\n\n[1] e.g., ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/patternfly1-1.1.1-1.fc20.src.rpm\n\nAsk @rhamilto or @EmilyDirsh to add a new build on [Fedora Copr](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/patternfly/patternfly1/add_build/) using the URL created in the previous step.\n\nEdit `MAKEFILE` as follows and commit the change:\n\n```\nVERSION=<new_version + 1>\nMILESTONE=master\nPACKAGE_RPM_RELEASE=0.0.$(MILESTONE)\n# PACKAGE_RPM_RELEASE=1\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee [https://www.patternfly.org](https://www.patternfly.org) and [http://getbootstrap.com/](http://getbootstrap.com/).\n\n### Browser and Device Support\n\nSince PatternFly is based on Bootstrap, PatternFly supports [the same browsers as Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support), plus the latest version of [Firefox for Linux](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux).\n\n*Important:*  the following features of PatternFly are not compatible with Internet Explorer 8:\n\n* [Bootstrap Tree View](https://github.com/jonmiles/bootstrap-treeview)\n* Charts (which utilizes [C3](http://c3js.org/) and [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki#browser--platform-support))\n\n### Product Backlog\n\nSee [https://trello.com/b/Hz3Nmwk4/patternfly-reference-implementation](https://trello.com/b/Hz3Nmwk4/patternfly-reference-implementation).\n\n## License\n\nModifications to Bootstrap are copyright 2013 Red Hat, Inc. and licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\n",
